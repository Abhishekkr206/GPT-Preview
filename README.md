A Chrome extension and preview website that adds Quick Preview and Full Preview buttons to code blocks on AI chat platforms allowing users to safely preview HTML CSS and JavaScript output in a sandboxed environment

---

## Problem

AI chat platforms generate frontend code frequently but they do not provide a reliable way to preview it

* No live rendering of HTML CSS JS
* Copy paste required to test code
* Running JavaScript directly on AI pages is unsafe

This project solves that by providing one click previews without compromising security

---

## What This Project Does

* Detects code blocks (<pre><code>) on AI chat websites
* Injects two buttons near each code block

  * Quick Preview lightweight inline preview
  * Full Preview full sandboxed execution
* Safely executes code in an isolated iframe
* Uses a temporary backend to avoid long URLs
* Automatically deletes old previews to prevent storage growth

---

## How It Works High Level Flow

1. Content Script scans the page for code blocks
2. Preview buttons are injected into the UI
3. On Full Preview

   * Code is sent to the background service worker
   * Stored temporarily in Supabase
   * A preview website is opened with a short ID
4. The Preview Website

   * Fetches the code using the ID
   * Renders it inside a sandboxed iframe
5. A cron job automatically deletes expired previews

---

## Main Components

* Chrome Extension (MV3)

  * content.js UI injection and code extraction
  * background.js Supabase communication

* Supabase

  * Temporary code storage
  * Auto cleanup using database cron jobs

* Preview Website (React + Vite)

  * Fetches code using preview ID
  * Executes code safely inside a sandboxed iframe

---

## Security Design

Security is a core design goal

* User JavaScript never runs inside the AI page
* User JavaScript never runs inside the extension context
* Code executes only inside a sandboxed iframe
* No persistent storage of user data
* Automatic cleanup of preview data

Iframe configuration

```html
sandbox="allow-scripts"
```

## Technologies Used

* Chrome Extensions Manifest V3
* JavaScript ES Modules
* Supabase PostgreSQL and cron jobs
* React and Vite
* Sandboxed iframes

---

## Auto Cleanup Strategy

To prevent unlimited database growth

* Each preview includes a created_at timestamp
* A Supabase cron job deletes previews older than a fixed duration
* Cleanup runs automatically without user interaction

---

## Privacy

* No personal data is collected
* Preview code is stored temporarily only
* Data is automatically deleted after expiration
* No analytics or user tracking

---

## Development Usage

### Load the Chrome extension locally

1. Open chrome://extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Click Load unpacked
4. Select the GptPreview-extension/extension folder

### Run the preview website locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Deployment

* Preview website can be deployed on platforms like Vercel
* Extension redirects users to the deployed preview URL
* Supabase allowed origins include the deployed domain

---

## Limitations By Design

* This is a preview tool not a full IDE
* No persistent preview history
* No authentication system
* Code must be provided as a single HTML file with inline CSS and JS

These decisions keep the project simple fast and secure
